# The keyword include_in_schema=False included in the decorator hides the path operation from the schema used to autogenerate API docs.
# The reason is that favicon requests (/favicon.ico) are automatically sent by browsers, but they are not part of the API’s core functionality. Including it in the schema could clutter the auto-generated API documentation (e.g., Swagger UI), which should focus on actual API endpoints. By using include_in_schema=False, you keep the API docs clean while still serving the favicon when requested.
